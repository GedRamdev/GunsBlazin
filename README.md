# GunsBlazin

Goal: The project was created for the sole goal of testing newer Unity versions and the added functions of the Editor in a game developers’ environment before shipping out to our users - the newest Stream, in this projects case it was 2022.1
Short Description: Rogue-Like shooter, where you are put into an arena with endless enemies and have to survive as long as possible and also become stronger with dropped upgrades from dead enemies such as Extra Dash, More Health, More Damage…

My task: Create a fully functional movement system and make sure the map is playable with said movement system, modify it so that it would be fun and challenging at the same-time
Summary: This project was made by 4 people in total and in one week (internal Unity yearly GameJam) and GitHub was used as our Version Control system (GitHub Desktop to be precise). To create said project, user created Assets were used from the asset store and all of the credit goes to the respective creators, so I will not be sharing the project and only the build of it...


Hope you like it!
